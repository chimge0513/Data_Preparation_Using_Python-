# Gender_Pay_Gap_Data_Preparation_Using_Python_
The dataset, “Gender Pay Gap” has been taken from glassdoor and focuses on income for various job titles based on gender. As there have been many studies showcasing that women are paid less than men for the same job titles, this data set will be helpful in identifying the depth of the gender-based pay gap. Through this project, i explored various data preparation and cleaning methods to get the dataset ready for visualizations. The dataset was further uploaded to SQLite to join/merge with other datasets.
